# ShaktiAI-Emergency-Alert-System
ShaktiAI is a smart SOS system using AI-powered gesture, facial, and voice detection to identify emergencies. Alerts are sent to nearby volunteers, and an Admin Dashboard tracks incidents and responses in real-time, enabling fast, efficient personal safety monitoring.

# ShaktiAI ‚Äì Prototype (UI + Admin)

‚ö†Ô∏è *This project is part of a **hackathon**. Code is open for learning and demo purposes only. All IP is retained by the authors for future publication.*

This repository contains a **prototype** of the ShaktiAI system.  
It includes the **mobile app (Pilgrim & Volunteer UI)** and the **Admin dashboard**, but **AI models and MongoDB Atlas database are not yet connected**.  
The goal of this repo is to showcase the **user flow, offline-first concept, and demo-ready UI** for hackathons/presentations.

## üöÄ Features in This Prototype

- **Role-based Mobile App (React Native + Expo)**
  - **Pilgrim**: UI for SOS button + placeholders for AI detection.
  - **Volunteer**: Receives *mock alerts*, views incidents on map, and acknowledges response.

- **Mocked AI Models**
  - Gesture, motion inactivity, and scream detection are **stubbed with demo triggers**.

- **Offline Alert Transmission (Concept Only)**
  - Placeholder modules for Wi-Fi Direct & Bluetooth mesh.

- **Admin Dashboard (React.js)**
  - Displays *mock incidents*, volunteer responses, and density maps.

- **Demo Mode**
  - Includes mock responses for smooth hackathon demonstration.

## üõ† Tech Stack

**Mobile App (Prototype)**
- React Native + Expo
- React Navigation (role-based flows)
- Realm/SQLite (local DB stubs)
- Mapbox / Google Maps (volunteer navigation)
- TensorFlow Lite + MediaPipe + Vosk (**planned for AI models**)

**Admin Dashboard (Prototype)**
- React.js + TypeScript
- Chart.js / Recharts (mock analytics)
- Firebase Auth Stub (placeholder login)

**Database (Planned Integration)**
- MongoDB Atlas (shared DB for both Mobile App & Admin Dashboard)  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently not connected ‚Äì mock data is used instead.

**Networking (Planned Integration)**
- Wi-Fi Direct + Bluetooth LE Mesh (offline alert transmission)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Mobile App
bash
cd shaktiai-mvp/mobile
npm install
npx expo start --host lan
  -Open Expo Go on your phone ‚Üí scan QR code.

  -Login as Pilgrim or Volunteer.

  -Trigger SOS or mock AI alerts for demo.

### 2. Admin Dashboard
bash
Copy code

npm install
npm start
  -Runs at http://localhost:3000.

  -Shows mock incidents and volunteer responses.

üìä Demo Flow
1- Pilgrim taps SOS (or triggers a mock AI event).

2- Volunteer app receives mock alert.

3- Volunteer acknowledges ‚Üí incident appears on Admin dashboard.

4- Admin dashboard displays analytics from mock data.

üì¶ Included in This Prototype

* UI for Pilgrim & Volunteer roles
* Mock alert transmission modules
* Demo incidents for Admin dashboard

Placeholder code for AI & DB integration

## **Final Demo Checklist**

**Before Demo**:
- [ ] Phone 1: Expo Go installed
- [ ] Phone 2: Expo Go installed  
- [ ] Laptop: Two terminals ready
- [ ] Browser: Ready for localhost:3000

**During Demo**:

### **Roadmap (Next Steps)**
1. Integrate TensorFlow Lite + MediaPipe gesture model in app

2. Add motion inactivity (faint detection) model

3. Integrate Vosk offline scream detection

4. Connect MongoDB for incident storage & sync

5. Implement real Wi-Fi Direct & BLE mesh alerts
